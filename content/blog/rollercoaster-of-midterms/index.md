# The Emotional Rollercoaster of College Midterms  

They say college is where you find yourself, but during midterms, I mostly found myself buried under school work. These are the emotions I experienced during my first midterms—and how I handled them.  

## Stage 1: Denial  
“Midterms? Already? There’s no way.” I spent the first week ignoring my to-do list, convincing myself I had plenty of time. Spoiler: I didn’t.  

### What Helped:  
- Making a detailed schedule with deadlines. Seeing it on paper snapped me out of denial.  

## Stage 2: Panic  
When I finally started studying, I panicked. There was too much to learn, and I didn’t know where to start.  

### What Helped:  
- Breaking it down. I listed everything I needed to study, then tackled one small piece at a time.  

## Stage 3: Exhaustion  
By day three, I was running on fumes. Every coffee-fueled hour of studying left me more tired than the last.  

### What Helped:  
- Stretching every hour or so and going to the gym once a day.  

## Stage 4: Relief (Kind Of)  
After my last exam, I felt a rush of relief—but also regret. I knew I could’ve prepared better, and that’s my plan for next time.  

### What I’ll Do Differently:  
- Start early and prioritize.  
- Use breaks to recharge instead of scrolling on my phone.  

## The Takeaway  
Midterms were intense, but they taught me a lot about managing stress and staying organized. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, know that it’s normal—and that you’ll come out stronger on the other side.
