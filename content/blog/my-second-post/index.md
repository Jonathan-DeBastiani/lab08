# What I Wish I Knew Before College Midterms  

Midterms are like a party you dont want to be at. I thought I was ready, but after this first round, I’ve learned some hard truths about balancing academics, athletics, and staying sane. Here’s what I wish I knew before diving into midterms.  

## 1. You Can’t Do Everything  
Between clubs, social events, and assignments, I stretched myself too thin. By the time midterms rolled around, I felt overwhelmed.  

### Lesson Learned:  
- It’s okay to say no. Cutting back on activities gave me room to breathe.  

## 2. Study Smarter, Not Longer  
I spent hours rereading my notes but still struggled to remember key points during the exams. Turns out, my study methods needed an upgrade.  

### What Worked:  
- **Flashcards**: Repetition helped me memorize key formulas.  
- **Practice Problems**: Applying concepts made them stick.  

## 3. Your Professors Want to Help  
I was nervous about going to office hours, but when I did, my professor clarified concepts I’d been struggling with for weeks.  

### Takeaway:  
- Don’t wait! Asking for help early can save you time and stress.  

## 4. Mental Health Matters  
I underestimated how much stress could affect me. Midterms taught me to recognize when I needed a break.  

### My Tips:  
- Take a walk, call a friend, or watch an episode of your favorite show.  
- Remember, it’s okay to not be perfect.  

## Final Thoughts  
Midterms were tough, but I survived—and learned a lot along the way. If you’re gearing up for yours, remember: preparation and self-care go hand-in-hand.
