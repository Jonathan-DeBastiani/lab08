# Surviving My First College Midterms  

Midterms week hit me like a ton of bricks. One moment I was happily exploring campus, and the next, I was drowning in assignments, study guides, and coffee cups. Here’s how I survived my first midterms—and what I’ll do differently next time.  

## The Procrastination Trap  
I’ll admit it: I waited too long to start studying. High school had me fooled into thinking I could study the night before and ace the test. Spoiler alert: that doesn’t work in college. By the second exam, I realized I needed a better plan.  

### My Fix:  
- **Start Early**: Even reviewing 20 minutes a day made a big difference.  
- **Break It Down**: I split subjects into chunks instead of tackling everything at once.  

## The Caffine Overload  
Caffine became my go-to, but drinking so much of it eventually burned me out. I learned that is not a way to support myself when exausted or tires

### My Fix:  
- **Balance Is Key**: I added water and powerade to stay hydrated.  
- **Actual Food**: Eating meals with protein and carbs gave me real energy.  

## The Sleep Struggle  
Everyone says, “Sleep is for the weak,” but skipping sleep made my brain foggy and my mood terrible.  

### My Fix:  
- **Power Naps**: A 30-minute nap between study sessions worked wonders.  
- **Set a Cutoff**: I stopped studying past midnight to prioritize rest.  

## Reflection  
Midterms weren’t easy, but I came out stronger—and a little wiser. Next time, I’ll plan ahead, take care of myself, and maybe even stress a little less.
